## ✨ About me
I'm originally from Florence 🇮🇹 and recently moved to Mainz 🇩🇪.  
I love walking along the river, learning new languages, and turning data into insight (and sometimes into ✨plots✨).  
When I’m not debugging integrals, you’ll probably find me with a book, a crochet hook, or a Bahn ticket in hand.
